Enrichments (e9s) for Ruby Internationalization (i18n)

== Introduction

E9s was created due to the need of simply implementing i18n within a Rails application. It enriches I18n, Formastic, the String and Symbol classes to make life easier for the developer.

== How to use

1. Install the e9s plugin
   script/plugin install git://github.com/archan937/e9s.git 

2. Install the formtastic plugin (optional)
   script/plugin install git://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic.git

3. Place predefined YML files (for the used locales) in /config/locals/ (optional)
   download from http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale

4. Add translations within local YML files in /config/locals/

5. Start translating within controllers, models and/or views

6. Enjoy! :D
